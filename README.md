# dotfiles
Just my dotfiles for zsh with a little install script to install os specific powerlevel9k stuff (iTunes and Battery segment on OSX in my case)

Automatically installs:
- [antigen for zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) 
- pygments via pip3  

.zshrc also installs parts from [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and the [powerlevel9k theme](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k)
