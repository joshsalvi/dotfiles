# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles with customization that I have come to prefer. The script `install.sh` will create symlinks for `zshrc`, `bashrc`, and `vimrc`. 

The dotfiles use 
- [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh)
- [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- [Dracula Pro Theme](https://draculatheme.com/pro)

And my preferred terminal app is iTerm. Follow the installation instructions for each of the pages above to get everything working.
